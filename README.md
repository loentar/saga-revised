# Saga Revised

> Saga Revised is a server emulator for Ragnarok Online 2: The Gate of the World.

Saga Revised is the new and improved Saga.
The new system is less hardcoded based and more on input data.

The data that we provide is official data that we mainly extract throughout a gigantic database of packetlogs.
The numbers of players on the official servers have been decreased and so are our packetlogs so the data isn't entirely trustworthy to be compatible with latest calculations.

## Getting Started

### Sources Compilation

#### Windows Instructions

You need to have [.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) installed in order to be able to build the emulator.
Then simply run the script `build.bat` in the project root directory and wait until everything is done.

#### Linux Instructions

To build Saga Revised under Linux you must have [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) installed.
Recent Linux distributions do not ship with .NET framework 3.5, but it's possible to build Saga Revised with .NET framework 4.5.

To do this, install `mono-complete` package and create a symbolic link 4.5 -> 3.5 like this:

```bash
sudo apt install mono-complete
sudo mv /usr/lib/mono/3.5 /usr/lib/mono/3.5~
sudo ln -s 4.5 /usr/lib/mono/3.5
```

Now, download and compile lua for Mono like this:

```bash
sudo apt install lua5.1 liblua5.1-dev mono-devel build-essential
mkdir -p ~/devel
cd ~/devel
git clone https://github.com/stevedonovan/MonoLuaInterface.git
cd MonoLuaInterface/src
./configure
make
cd ../..

# place libraries to saga-revised
rm -f saga-revised/Dependecies/[Ll]ua*
cp -f MonoLuaInterface/bin/*.dll MonoLuaInterface/bin/*.so saga-revised/Dependecies/
```

Then, run `build.sh` to build Saga Revised.

> Saga.Tools.Tasks currently doesn't build under Mono.

### Deploy

Deploy like this:

```bash
deploy=~/saga-server
mkdir -p $deploy
cp -R Binary Data Quests Dependecies Saga.Scripting $deploy/
```

### Setting up the SQL database

#### MySQL Installation for Linux

Follow guide https://docs.vultr.com/how-to-install-mysql-5-7-on-ubuntu-20-04

TL;DR:

```bash
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb
# select bionic, 5.7 version
sudo apt update
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys KEY_FROM_THE_ERROR
sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
sudo apt install -f mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7*
```

Populate DB:
```bash
cd Database
cp db.conf.example db.conf
chmod 600 db.conf
mcedit db.conf
# edit db, user and password
bash import_all
```

Create user for the server:

```sql
CREATE USER 'saga'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON saga.* To 'saga'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';

```

Replace "<PASSWORD>" with your user password.


#### MySQL Installation for Windows

Download [MySQL Installer](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/) and install at least MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. Then start MySQL Workbench and check in `startup / shutdown` if the MySQL Server is running.

> MySQL <5.1 is not supported.

#### Database Creation

In MySQL Workbench, create a new schema (database) called "saga", open it and run all SQL scripts in the directory `Database\Mysql` of the emulator. This will create every tables in the schema.

### Setting up the emulator

#### Saga.Map

Run it. You will be asked to create a world server, choose ID 1, give a max player number and a passcode. Set the rates, type 1 to load every plugins, finally say no 2 times and then yes for the last question. Enter your database settings like in this example:

```bash
database name: saga
database username: root
database password: <root_password>
database port: 3306
database host: localhost
```

Close it.

#### Saga.Authentication

Run it and type 1 to load the plugin. Say no to the 2 next questions and yes for the last one. Use the same database settings as above:

```bash
database name: saga
database username: root
database password: <root_password>
database port: 3306
database host: localhost
```

Close it.

#### Saga.Gateway

Run it and say no to everything. Close it.

#### Adding the world server in the database

Open `Saga.Map.config`, go to the line which looks like `<Saga.Manager.NetworkSettings world="1" playerlimit="50" proof="2C6CFC5F906506F46HHKIU679Y6J8Y7K">` and copy the proof somewhere. Open MySQL Workbench, open a new query tab and execute the following command:

```sql
INSERT INTO `list_worlds` (`Id`, `Name`, `Proof`)
VALUES (1, '<world_name>', '<proof>');
```

replacing `<world_name>` with whatever you want and `<proof>` with the same proof found in `Saga.Map.config`.
Now you're done, you can launch the server.

## FAQ

### I can't build the emulator under Windows

Sometimes the `build.bat` script doesn't work *out-of-the-box*. Check that the path to `MSBuild.exe` is correct by editing the script and/or try to run the script with administrator privileges.

### Where can I get a client of the game?

You can download the latest [DiviniaRO2 full client](https://mega.co.nz/#!yZhlkB5S!j6zia8kE_uLZ65WaJavDS-nVvq7-vyDgtGfRIbcmm9E).

### How do I create a player account?

Type `account -create <username> <password> male` in the `Saga.Authentication` console to create a male account by replacing `<username>` and `<password>` with whatever you want (use female to create a female account).

### How do I connect to the server with my game client?

You need to run the game executable with some options. For example, you can use a batch script with the command: `"System\RagII.exe" ServerIP=127.0.0.1 ServerPort=64000`.

### I can't login to my player account

If you can't login to your player account, restart the server and before trying to login to your player account, type `host -connect` in the `Saga.Gateway` console. You don't have to do that each time you want to login to a player account, just once after launching the server.

## Known Issues

No lua command to add a new weapon to your inventory. We do have all the packets and know how to use them however.

There is a targeting problem when casting emoticons on other people. We have to debug where this goes wrong.
To debug the server, run the server from the binary folder, in Visual Studio -> Tools -> Attach to process -> Saga.Map.Exe.
Set a break point on the function where it does the offensive attack, and use the intermediate window to check which expression
is evaluated as false.

AI is still a bit dumb. We need to figure out a way to read out all the height information for closed rooms with multiple height planes in order to fix this.
This will take a long amount of time so bear with the dumb ai for now.

If the computer is extremely stressed loading the lua quest files ad-hoc can cause problems.
Lua reads the files ASCII encoding so if you save it with unicode encoding this causes issues also.
A fix could be to preload all quest files and add a reload command.

Mysql <5.1 or >8.0 is not supported. However both Mysql 6.x and 5.1 are supported, recommended version is MySql 5.7.

The server has never been tested under a stressful environment. Be aware to expect bugs in that corner or even uncompatibility.

The server works under Mono.
